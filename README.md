A server-based M.U.L.E. clone

Work in progress PHP port of the M.U.L.E. strategy game.

Backend is about halfway done. No frontend whatsoever, just a test console.

As far as frontend, the idea is you'll be able to create an mobile app, web app, desktop app, etc. and skin it however you want. I'm planning extensibility in the rules so that new games can be created that run off the server using custom rulesets.
